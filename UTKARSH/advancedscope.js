/* there are mainly 4 types of scope 
1 ) hoisting : we can use variable or function before its declaration , bydefault all variable move to the top
2 ) lexical scope : a child function can access their parent function data .
3 ) closure scope : a function after the execution still persists its state .
4 ) currying scope : we can break , or we can separate argument list in individual function and 
                     call it together .
